What is sql pool?

sql pool is a collection of query slots

for complex queries and connection checking
use: 

1. connection = await pool.getConnection() -- borrow a connection from collection
2. connection.query()
3. connection.release() -- return the borrowed connection slot back to the collection so that other funcs can use them

* if connection checking, just do query select 1 to see if it works

for simple and fast queries
use:
1. pool.query() = connect, query, release
